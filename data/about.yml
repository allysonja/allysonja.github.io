  description: Risk of Rain 2 is a rogue-like masterpiece with amazing 3D graphics. I've never enjoyed rogue-like games, as the frustration of being killed after hours of grinding and work to become OP has always overpowered my enjoyment of the storyline, and the learning curves tend to be white large. Risk of Rain 2 is playable without lots of research into the game, and you can figure out the strengths and weaknesses of the characters and which items to stack for character upgrades, just by playing through the game.
